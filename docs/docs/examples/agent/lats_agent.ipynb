            "**Financial Data:**\n",
            "1. **Uber** did not disclose specific revenue figures in the provided information, focusing more on their financial management practices and the quality of their financial instruments. They emphasized the high credit quality of their cash equivalents and securities, and the use of GAAP-compliant financial statements influenced by estimates considering the COVID-19 impact.\n",

            "1. **Uber's** key risk factors include concentration of credit risk, with their financial assets placed in high-credit-quality institutions, and various uncertainties that could affect their forward-looking statements and actual results. They manage risks related to their financial estimates and the broader economic impacts of the pandemic.\n",

They also express concerns about the uncertain market and their ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\n",
            "\n",

            "While Uber's discussion focuses on the management of high-quality financial assets and the broader implications of their financial estimates, Lyft provides more concrete financial results and a detailed list of operational and market risks. Lyft's explicit revenue figures and detailed risk enumeration offer a clearer picture of their financial health and challenges compared to Uber's more generalized financial overview. This analysis suggests that Lyft provides more transparency in their financial reporting, but also highlights more vulnerability in terms of revenue recovery and risk exposure compared to Uber.\n",

Financial risks for Uber highlight a concentration of credit risk primarily in high-credit-quality money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Despite the risks of exceeding insured limits, Uber has not reported significant losses in this area.\n",

Risk factors for Lyft include the ability to forecast revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain drivers and riders, comply with new regulations, and handle the ongoing impacts of COVID-19. Lyft also faces risks from macroeconomic changes, reputation management, growth management, and uncertainties in achieving or maintaining profitability.\n",
